This Tic-Tac-Toe project is a simple web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns placing 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game detects a winner when one player aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all cells are filled without a winner, it ends in a draw. Players can reset the game at any time using the "Reset Game" button. To use it, simply open the index.html file in a browser. The project includes the core files: index.html for the structure, style.css for styling, and script.js for game logic, making it easy to understand and modify for anyone interested in building a similar project or contributing to it
